# day3: Calender üóìÔ∏è

### Requirements
- Create a calendar, and when user clicks the left and right arrows, it navigates to the corresponding month.
- When user clicks the specific day, the notepad for that day should be displayed.
  - In the notepad,  user can save memo.
  - After entering a memo, when user returns to the calendar screen, a small circle indicating the memo is saved on the corresponding day.
  - If the user clicks the day a memo is saved, saved memo should be displayed with input field for new memo.
  - Each memo can be modified.

### Issue
- Couldn't implement a circle indicating the memo is saved on each day

### Things to improve
- use Ajax and json to save and load memos
- design for memo input field & task list
